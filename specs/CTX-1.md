# CTX-1: Capability & Trust eXtensions

## Status of This Memo

This document provides information for the Agent Control Layer community. It does not specify a standard but defines conventions that implementations SHOULD follow for interoperability. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

## Abstract

The Capability & Trust eXtensions (CTX-1) defines a common vocabulary and naming convention for **capability strings** used in:

- AIP-1 `Capability-Set` X.509 extension (`1.3.6.1.4.1.59999.1.4`)
- ADP-1 `agent.aip.capabilities`

Its goals are:

- Provide a **stable, readable set of capability names** that map cleanly onto ACL's RBAC model
- Enable **cross-framework understanding** of what an agent is allowed to do
- Avoid overfitting to any single product or internal table structure

## 1. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

**Capability**: A string representing a permission, identity, or constraint granted to an agent.

**Prefix**: The namespace portion of a capability string before the first colon.

**Qualifier**: Additional scoping after the capability name (e.g., resource type, limit).

## 2. Naming Convention

Capabilities are simple strings with the following pattern:

```
<prefix>:<name>[:<qualifier>...]
```

**Examples:**
- `agent:coach`
- `tenant:tenant-123`
- `service_account:svc-xyz`
- `perm:workflows:read`
- `perm:inputs:write`
- `budget:usd:100`

**Rules:**

1. Names MUST contain only lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `-`, or `_`
2. Names SHOULD be stable over time; when behavior changes significantly, prefer a new capability name
3. Unknown capabilities MUST be ignored (fail-safe) by consumers who do not understand them
4. Prefixes MUST NOT contain colons
5. The total string length SHOULD NOT exceed 256 characters

## 3. Reserved Prefixes

The following prefixes are reserved and SHOULD be interpreted consistently:

| Prefix | Purpose | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `agent:` | Identifies a logical agent | `agent:coach`, `agent:analyst` |
| `tenant:` | Identifies a tenant/organization | `tenant:tenant-123` |
| `service_account:` | Identifies a backing service account | `service_account:svc-xyz` |
| `perm:` | Encodes an RBAC permission | `perm:workflows:read`, `perm:files:write` |
| `budget:` | Encodes budget constraints | `budget:usd:100`, `budget:tokens:100000` |
| `env:` | Encodes environment constraints | `env:production`, `env:staging` |
| `role:` | Encodes a role bundle | `role:analyst`, `role:admin` |

Other prefixes MAY be defined by implementations as long as they do not conflict with the above.

## 4. Recommended Capabilities

### 4.1 Identity Capabilities

These identify the agent and its organizational context:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `agent:<agent_key>` | Logical agent identifier (e.g., `agent:coach`) |
| `tenant:<tenant_id>` | Tenant/organization identifier |
| `service_account:<id>` | Backing service account (if applicable) |

### 4.2 Permission Capabilities

Format: `perm:<resource>:<action>`

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `perm:workflows:read` | Read workflow definitions |
| `perm:workflows:write` | Create/modify workflows |
| `perm:workflows:execute` | Execute workflows |
| `perm:inputs:read` | Read input data |
| `perm:inputs:write` | Write input data |
| `perm:files:read` | Read files |
| `perm:files:write` | Write files |
| `perm:secrets:read` | Read secrets (restricted) |

### 4.3 Constraint Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `budget:usd:<amount>` | Maximum USD spend limit |
| `budget:tokens:<amount>` | Maximum token usage limit |
| `env:production` | Valid only in production |
| `env:staging` | Valid only in staging |

## 5. RBAC Mapping

ACL's RBAC model uses `{ resource: string; action: string }` pairs. The mapping to CTX-1 is:

```
RBAC { resource: "workflows", action: "read" }  →  "perm:workflows:read"
RBAC { resource: "inputs",    action: "write" } →  "perm:inputs:write"
```

**Guidelines:**

- Include only high-value, stable permissions as capabilities
- Avoid encoding highly dynamic or contextual permissions
- Implementation-specific permissions SHOULD use a namespaced prefix (e.g., `acl:internal:debug`)

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Capability Escalation** | Capabilities are cryptographically bound to AIP-1 certificates |
| **Spoofing** | Verify capabilities against signed certificate |
| **Namespace Collision** | Use reserved prefixes; reject unknown prefixes in strict mode |
| **Information Disclosure** | Capability strings may reveal organizational structure |

### 6.2 Capability Validation

Verifiers SHOULD:
- Parse capability strings according to the naming convention
- Recognize and enforce reserved prefixes
- Reject malformed capabilities (missing prefix, invalid characters)
- Log unknown capabilities for monitoring

### 6.3 Least Privilege

- Agents SHOULD receive the minimum capabilities required
- Broad capabilities (e.g., `perm:*:*`) SHOULD NOT be issued
- Budget capabilities SHOULD have conservative limits

## 7. Conformance

### 7.1 Conformance Requirements

**Producers** (certificate issuers) MUST:
- Follow the naming convention in Section 2
- Use reserved prefixes correctly per Section 3
- Encode capabilities as a JSON array in AIP-1 Capability-Set

**Consumers** (verifiers) MUST:
- Parse capabilities according to the naming convention
- Ignore unknown capabilities (fail-safe)
- NOT grant access based solely on unrecognized capabilities

**Consumers** SHOULD:
- Validate capability format
- Log unknown capabilities for monitoring
- Support the full reserved prefix vocabulary

## 8. Future Work

- **Capability Categories**: Grouping (e.g., `perm:workflows:read` → category `data_read`)
- **Role Bundles**: `role:analyst` expands to a set of `perm:*` capabilities
- **Negative Capabilities**: `deny:files:write` for explicit denials
- **Capability Delegation**: Agent-to-agent capability transfer
