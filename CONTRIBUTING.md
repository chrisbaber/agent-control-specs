## Specification Change Process

Changes to specifications follow a structured process based on their impact:

### Errata (Typos, Clarifications)

- Minor corrections that do not change meaning
- Can be merged with single maintainer approval
- Documented in CHANGELOG under "Fixed"

### Minor Changes (Non-Breaking)

- New optional fields
- Additional examples
- Extended guidance
- Requires review period of 7 days
- Documented in CHANGELOG under "Added" or "Changed"

### Major Changes (Breaking)

- Changes to required fields
- Semantic changes to existing behavior
- New major version of a specification
- Requires:
  - RFC-style proposal document
  - 30-day public comment period
  - Approval from specification editors
- Results in new specification version (e.g., AIP-2)
