## [Unreleased]

### Added
- JSON Schema definitions for ADP-1 and PVS-1
- Example certificates, payloads, and test vectors
- SPEC-0 meta-specification defining specification governance
- Security Considerations sections in all specifications
- RFC 2119 normative language compliance
- Conformance requirements for each specification

### Changed
- Standardized frontmatter across all specifications to IETF RFC/EIP style
- Updated documentation to gold-standard professional presentation

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-23

### Changed

#### PVS-1: Policy Verdict Schema v1.1.0
- **BREAKING**: Added required `decision` field with values `"allow"`, `"deny"`, or `"escalate"`
- The `approved` field is now derived from `decision` for backwards compatibility
- Added Section 3.1: Escalation Handling with implementation guidelines
- Added recommendation that low confidence (< 0.7) SHOULD result in `decision: "escalate"`
- Updated examples to include `decision` field
- Added escalation priority to Future Work section

**Migration Guide:**
- Existing consumers should update to check `decision` field
- For backwards compatibility, `approved: true` maps to `decision: "allow"`
- For backwards compatibility, `approved: false` with violations maps to `decision: "deny"`
- New `decision: "escalate"` indicates human review is required

**Rationale:**
The boolean `approved` field was insufficient for cases where the policy engine is uncertain.
The new `decision` field allows explicit escalation to human reviewers, improving safety in
high-stakes scenarios where the engine lacks confidence in its verdict.
